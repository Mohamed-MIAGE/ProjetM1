(Useful Packages & Modules) Sensor/Actuator repository for MRAA\n==============\n\nThe UPM repository provides software drivers for a wide variety of commonly\nused sensors and actuators. These software drivers interact with the underlying\nhardware platform (or microcontroller), as well as with the attached sensors,\nthrough calls to [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) APIs.\n\nThese packages contain sources for the respective UPM modules and will compile\nlocally on the target using node-gyp when installed. They support Node.js 0.10\nor newer.\n\n### Installing\nThe UPM modules have a hard dependency on MRAA, thus you will have to install\nit first. Also, make sure Node can find MRAA by updating the `NODE_PATH`\nvariable if necessary. A global installation is preferred:\n\n`npm install mraa -g`\n\nAfter this, to install a UPM module using npm simply type:\n\n`npm install jsupm_<module-name> -g`\n\n### Usage\nUnfortunately, due to the way node-gyp builds MRAA and UPM, the platform\ninitialization hooks are lost. This means you will have to do it manually,\nand require MRAA *before* you load a UPM module:\n\n```\nrequire('mraa');\nvar lib = require('jsupm_<module-name>');\n```\n\n### Supported Sensors\nThe full list is available on [Intel® IoT Developer Zone](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/sensors).\n\n### IDE Integration\nIntel® XDK IoT Edition is the recommended IDE for Node.js development. Visit\nthe Intel® Developer Zone [IDE page](https://software.intel.com/iot/software/ide)\nfor more information on how to get started.\n\n![Intel XDK](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/docs/icons/xdk.png)\n\n### Building UPM\nSee building documentation [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/building.md).\n\n### Making your own UPM module\nOur porting [link](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/porting.md)\nhas more information on making new UPM modules. Also check out our main Github page as\nwe do have some guidelines if you would like to contribute your modules to the library.\n\n### API Documentation\nOur Node.js documentation pages are hosted [here](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/).\nFor other supported languages and their APIs please visit our main Github page.\n\n### API Compatibility\nEven if we try our best not to, every once in a while we are forced to modify\nour API in a way that will break backwards compatibility. If you find yourself\nunable to run code that was working fine before a library update, make sure\nyou check the [API changes](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/apichanges.md) section first.\n\n### Changelog\nVersion changelog [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/changelog.md).\n\n### Known Limitations\nList of known limitations [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/knownlimitations.md).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"propanu","email":"mihai.tudor.panu@intel.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-12-15T00:57:37.445Z","created":"2015-09-24T19:07:42.237Z","0.3.2":"2015-09-24T19:07:42.237Z","0.4.0":"2015-09-25T17:30:14.131Z","0.4.1":"2015-12-18T00:26:28.562Z","0.6.2":"2016-05-13T23:18:42.382Z","0.7.0":"2016-05-14T00:25:04.015Z","1.0.0-src":"2016-11-01T19:04:01.042Z","1.0.2-src":"2016-12-15T00:57:37.445Z"},"homepage":"http://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm","keywords":["intel","edison","galileo","minnow","io","mraajs","upmjs","gpio","spi","i2c","uart","aio","sensor","actuator"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5851ea81-338a\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:57:37 GMT"}
